## 🔥 Core Features: Delta Neutral Strategies

### 🆕 MachFi Delta Neutral Strategy

Our new MachFi-based Delta Neutral strategy offers an alternative approach:

1. 💰 **Supply USDC.e to MachFi** as collateral
2. 🏦 **Borrow S tokens** at 50% of borrowing capacity
3. 🔄 **Wrap S tokens to wS**
4. 🌾 **Deploy wS** into Beefy's high-yield wS-SwapX vault
5. 💸 **Earn positive yield spread** between borrowing costs and farming returns

### 🏦 Aave Delta Neutral Strategy

Our original Delta Neutral strategy delivers stable, market-neutral yields by balancing lending and yield farming positions:

1. 💰 **Supply USDC.e to Aave** as collateral
2. 🏦 **Borrow wS tokens** at 50% of borrowing capacity
3. 🌾 **Deploy borrowed wS** into Beefy's high-yield wS-SwapX vault
4. 💸 **Earn positive yield spread** between borrowing costs and farming returns

Both strategies offer these advantages:

- 🛡️ **Market Neutral Exposure**: Minimizes price risk for the borrowed asset
- 🤖 **Automatic Optimization**: Dynamically adjusts positions based on current market rates
- 📈 **Leveraged Yield**: Amplifies returns through strategic borrowing
- ⚖️ **Risk Managed**: Maintains safe health factors with built-in safeguards
