# 🚀 SONICdeltaAIMASTER

An intelligent blockchain assistant for Sonic Network, specializing in **Delta Neutral DeFi strategies** with comprehensive portfolio management and advanced yield optimization capabilities.

## 🔥 Core Feature: Delta Neutral Strategy

Our flagship Delta Neutral strategy delivers stable, market-neutral yields by balancing lending and yield farming positions:

1. 💰 **Supply USDC.e to Aave** as collateral
2. 🏦 **Borrow wS tokens** at 50% of borrowing capacity
3. 🌾 **Deploy borrowed wS** into Beefy's high-yield wS-SwapX vault
4. 💸 **Earn positive yield spread** between borrowing costs and farming returns

This sophisticated approach generates consistent returns regardless of token price movements, offering a low-risk DeFi strategy with these advantages:

- 🛡️ **Market Neutral Exposure**: Minimizes price risk for the borrowed asset
- 🤖 **Automatic Optimization**: Dynamically adjusts positions based on current market rates
- 📈 **Leveraged Yield**: Amplifies returns through strategic borrowing
- ⚖️ **Risk Managed**: Maintains safe health factors on Aave with built-in safeguards

### 🎯 Delta Neutral Commands

Check strategy APY:
```

```

Example Output:
```
## Delta Neutral Strategy - APY Breakdown

💰 **Beefy wS-SwapX Vault APY:** +15.00%
🏦 **Aave wS Borrow APY:** -4.00%

🔄 **Net Strategy APY:** 11.00%

✅ **Strategy is profitable!** The yield farming returns currently exceed borrowing costs.

### How It Works
1. Your USDC.e is supplied to Aave as collateral
2. 50% of your borrowing power is used to borrow wS
3. Borrowed wS is deployed in Beefy's wS-SwapX vault
4. You earn the spread between borrowing costs and farming returns
```

Execute the delta neutral strategy with a specific USDC.e amount:
```
execute-delta-neutral 10
```
